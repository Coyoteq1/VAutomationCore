## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, report it privately by emailing:
**Ahmadtllal1@gmail.com**

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested remediation

### What to expect

- Initial acknowledgment within **3 business days**
- Status updates at least every **7 business days** while the issue is open
- Confirmation when a fix is released (or if no fix is planned)

If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on remediation and coordinate
disclosure timing with you when appropriate. If the report is determined to be
out of scope or not reproducible, we will share the reasoning and close the
report.
