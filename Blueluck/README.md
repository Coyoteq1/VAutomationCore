## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Commands not working:**
- Ensure you have the required permissions for admin-only commands
- Check the server log for `Commands registered successfully`
- Use `!game help` to confirm the currently wired command surface

**Zone detection not working:**
- Use `!zone debug` to enable debug mode and check zone boundaries
- Verify zone coordinates in `zones.json` are correct
- Ensure players are within the defined zone radius

**Boss spawning issues:**
- Check boss prefab names in configuration files
- Verify spawn coordinates are valid and not obstructed
- Use `!boss status` to check spawn timers and cooldowns

**Flow system problems:**
- Use `!flow validate` to check for configuration errors
- Verify flow triggers are properly configured
- Check server logs for flow execution errors

**Snapshot restoration issues:**
- Ensure you have a valid snapshot saved before attempting restore
- Check that no conflicting buffs are preventing restoration
- Use `!snap status` to verify snapshot integrity

### Configuration Files

**kits.json** - Defines available equipment presets and abilities
**zones.json** - Configures zone boundaries and types  
**flows.json** - Sets up automated game state triggers and actions

### Server Logs

Check server logs for detailed error messages and mod status:
- Look for "Blueluck" entries in the log files
- Enable debug mode with `!debug toggle` for more verbose logging
- Report persistent issues with relevant log sections

### Performance Notes

- Zone detection runs efficiently with optimized algorithms
- Flow system uses minimal server resources
- Boss spawning is designed for smooth gameplay experience
- Snapshot system stores data locally per player

## Installation

1. Build the solution
2. Place the DLL in your V Rising server's BepInEx/plugins folder

## Configuration

Edit the JSON files in the `config` folder:
- `kits.json` - Kit definitions
- `zones.json` - Zone configurations
- `flows.json` - Flow settings

## Technical Architecture

### ECS Automation System

The Blueluck mod implements a sophisticated Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture for scalable automation:

- **Entities**: Players, bosses, zones, and game objects
- **Components**: Data structures defining state and properties
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on entities with specific components

### Registry System

Centralized configuration and state management through:

- **Flow Registry**: Manages all active flows and their triggers
- **Zone Registry**: Tracks zone definitions and player locations
- **Boss Registry**: Handles boss spawning, tracking, and lifecycle
- **Player Registry**: Manages player states, snapshots, and progression

### Automation Layers

**Per-Flow Controls**: Individual flow configuration with custom triggers and actions
**Per-Zone Controls**: Zone-specific automation rules and behaviors  
**Per-Time Controls**: Time-based triggers and cooldown management
**Per-Entity Controls**: Entity-specific automation and state management

### Crossmod Integration

The mod supports crossmod automation through:

- **Event System**: Publish/subscribe architecture for game events
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful interfaces for external mod communication
- **Configuration Hooks**: Extensible configuration system for other mods
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time state sharing between compatible mods
